# Eccentricity Comparison

This plot compares the final ice states for planets orbiting K (top), G (middle), and F (bottom) dwarf stars eccentricities e = 0 (solid), 0.1 (dashed), 0.2 (dotted), and 0.3 (dash-dotted). Ice belts are unstable at e > 0.3 for G star planets and e > 0.1 for F star planets, thus the respective curves are omitted.

#### _These instructions assume you have completed the [Static Cases](../StaticCases) and have built the BigPlanet archive._

Generate the plot with the following command:

```
python makeplot.py <pdf | png>
```

where the two arguments after makeplot.py set the output to either a pdf or png. This command will create this plot:
